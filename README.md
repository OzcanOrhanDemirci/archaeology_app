**Anatolia Heritage** is an information-centric Android mobile application designed to showcase 21 of Turkey's most significant archaeological sites (e.g., Ephesus, Troy, Göbeklitepe). Developed as a graduation project, it bridges the gap between academic depth and user experience, providing stratigraphic analyses and historical contexts in an offline-first environment.

## 📱 Features

* **Information-Centric Delivery:** Focuses on high-quality, academic content without the clutter of complex maps or navigation.
* **Offline First:** All data, images, and architectural analyses are bundled within the app, requiring no internet connection.
* **Stratigraphic Analysis:** Visualizes the historical layers (e.g., Troy's 9 layers, Ephesus's marine regression) using custom UI blocks.
* **Dynamic Theme Engine:** Features **8 distinct color flavors** (e.g., *Soft Denim, Imperial Purple, Amber Forest*) based on the "60-30-10" color rule.
* **Bilingual Support:** Full English and Turkish support with instant language switching via `localization.dart` .
* **Custom Timeline:** An interactive `HorizontalTimeline` widget to navigate through historical periods .

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

This project strictly adheres to **Clean Code** principles and avoids heavy third-party dependencies to demonstrate core Flutter proficiency.

### 1. Native State Management

Instead of using external libraries like Bloc or Provider, a custom `AppStateProvider` was implemented using Flutter's **`InheritedWidget`**. This manages the global state (Theme, Locale, Favorites) efficiently and performantly .

### 2. Data Registry & Lazy Loading

To optimize memory usage, the app uses a **Lazy Loading** pattern defined in `site_registry.dart`. Detailed content for the 21 sites is not loaded at startup; instead, it is fetched only when the user navigates to a specific site .

### 3. Modular File Structure

The project is organized into clear layers (Data, Core, Screens, Widgets, State) to ensure scalability.
